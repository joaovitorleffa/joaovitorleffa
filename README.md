### Hi there 👋

<!--
**joaovitorleffa/joaovitorleffa** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

My name is João Vitor, I live in Torres, Rio Grande do Sul. I am an intern at [RhizaTech Startup](http://www.rhizatech.com.br/), working as a programmer, using PHP and JavaScript languages. I am currently delving into two fantastic frameworks, React Native and Laravel. My first contact with programming occurred at the beginning of my graduation :mortar_board:, in 2018 at [ULBRA](https://www.ulbra.br/torres), where I learned languages ​​like Java and C.
My favorite hobbies are watching some anime, playing lol :video_game:, and listening to podcasts :headphones:.

Follow me :smiley:
