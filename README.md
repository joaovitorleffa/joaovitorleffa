### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

**joaovitorleffa/joaovitorleffa** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello :blush:! My name is JoÃ£o Vitor, I live in Torres, Rio Grande do Sul. I am an intern at [RhizaTech Startup](http://www.rhizatech.com.br/), working as a programmer, using PHP and JavaScript languages. I am currently delving into two fantastic frameworks, React Native and Laravel. My first contact with programming occurred at the beginning of my graduation :mortar_board:, in 2018 at ULBRA, where I learned languages â€‹â€‹like Java and C.
My favorite hobbies are watching some anime, mainly Naruto :satisfied:, playing lol :video_game:, and listening to podcasts :headphones:.

Follow me :smiley:
